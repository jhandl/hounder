Hounder allows you to **crawl** the web, **index** documents and **search** them. It can be used to **build a standard web search engine** or to **integrate into existing apps** to index and search  data.

Hounder is designed as a whole product, with the idea of bringing a complete search engine solution that **runs out of the box**. It includes an installation wizard (powered by [wiz4j](http://code.google.com/p/wiz4j)) and a webapp for monitoring & controlling all parts of the engine (powered by [clusterfest](http://opensource.flaptor.com/clusterfest/)).

Hounder is built in java based on Apache's Lucene. **It can be run as standalone process**, allowing for communication via different RPCs (xml-rpc, RMI, etc), **integrating with applications written in any language**.

Hounder was **designed for performance**, it can handle a great number of concurrent queries and can be distributed across several search and indexing servers to increase the number of indexed documents and query performance.
