Hounder is a simple and complete search system. Out of the box, Hounder crawls the web targeting only those documents of interest, and presents them through a simple search web page. Hounder is:

      * configurable: Hounder can be customized for your particular needs. Use it as a standalone solution or as a building block for your existing application.
      * scalable: Hounder grows with your needs. Start with a single machine, add more as needed.
      * robust: The big bad web is no place for puppies. Hounder's searcher has been designed from the beginning to survive traffic surges.
      * easy to integrate: Hounder can be used from various languages, such as Java, PHP, Python, etc.
      * trainable: point Hounder's attention to the information you want by feeding it with training sets, then sit back and watch it fetch the right documents for you.
  See for yourself!
