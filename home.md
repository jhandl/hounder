Hounder is a simple and complete search system. Out of the box, Hounder crawls the web targeting only those documents of interest, and presents them through a simple search web page. Hounder is:

  * configurable: Hounder can be customized for your particular needs. Use it as a standalone solution or as a building block for your existing application.
  * scalable: Hounder grows with your needs. Start with a single machine, add more as needed.
  * robust: The big bad web is no place for puppies. Hounder's searcher has been designed from the beginning to survive traffic surges.
  * easy to integrate: Hounder can be used from various languages, such as Java, PHP, Python, etc.
  * trainable: point Hounder's attention to the information you want by feeding it with training sets, then sit back and watch it fetch the right documents for you.
